# Getting Started with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes files directly from a repository on GitHub, runs them through a build process, and publishes a website. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of Git
- Understanding of Markdown syntax

## Steps to Create Your First GitHub Pages Site

1. **Create a New Repository**
   - Go to GitHub.com and click the "+" icon in the top right
   - Select "New repository"
   - Name your repository `username.github.io` (replace username with your GitHub username)
   - Make it public
   - Initialize with a README

2. **Choose Your Publishing Source**
   - Go to your repository's Settings
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
   - Select your publishing source (usually the main branch)
   - Choose your theme or use a custom theme

3. **Add Content**
   - Create or edit `index.md` in your repository
   - Use Markdown to write your content
   - Commit your changes

4. **Customize Your Site**
   - Edit `_config.yml` to set your site's title and description
   - Choose and customize your theme
   - Add your own CSS if needed

## Best Practices

- Keep your repository public
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Test your site locally before pushing changes
- Use relative links for internal navigation
- Include a README.md file with setup instructions

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Site Not Updating**
   - Check if your changes are committed
   - Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
   - Verify your branch settings

2. **Theme Not Applying**
   - Ensure your `_config.yml` is properly formatted
   - Check if the theme name is correct
   - Clear your browser cache

3. **404 Errors**
   - Verify file paths are correct
   - Check if files are in the correct branch
   - Ensure file names match exactly
